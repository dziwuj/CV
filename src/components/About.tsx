            <p>
                I am an ambitious student looking for new challenges. I am
                interested in electronics, psychology, game design and video
                editing. Additionally, I am a very communicative and open
                person, which is why I enjoy travelling, meeting new people and
                broadening my horizons. I love analysing problems and solving
                them in the best, most optimal way.
            </p>
